# BTCX
Bitcoin (coinbase) algorithmic trading API

# Usage info
There is a virtualenv with all necessary libraries (including this very project) installed. To open it: I know at least for Mac/Linux you can 'cd' into env and type 'source bin/activate'. If you see your command line prefixed by '(env)' you're set.

A lot of the code refers to "keys.txt". This should be a text file with three lines, the first being your API key, 
the second being your secret key, and the third being your passcode. These are needed for an authorized connection
to CBE.
